GestiónLibre is a migration/rewrite of a own legacy application made in Visual
Basic classic, and the former was used in a wide variety of bussiness (retail,
manufacturing, services, education, associations, etc.)

Based on a double-entry bookkeeping system, uses a relational model to represent
"Documents" (invoices, receips, deposit slip, etc.) detailing financial 
transactions ("operations"), that are instantaneous recorded ("movements" in a 
unified Sales/Cash/Bank/Purchase/etc. book using "concepts" -accounts details-), 
and later can be totaled and the summaries posted into the journal/ledger.

We think this approach is superior to an object-oriented model (for example, 
having rigid classes like Invoice, Sales Orders, Parts, etc.), and has proven
to be more flexible to adapt to changing requeriments and new reporting needs.

Altough it can be adapted to "Anglo-Saxon" Financial Accounting and Reporting 
standards, this application is initially based on "Continental Accounting" 
(specifically "Latin Accounting" of Argentina), so, expect to see things in a 
different/unusual way (specially if you are from UK, USA or related countries), 
the process may vary, but the results should be the same.

Full internationalization will be supported, but spanish is our main language, 
so there may be errors or inaccuracies with our written English.

Developed with web2py.

As it was closed source using propietary technologies, its code will not be 
publicly released (only documentation and manuals needed to do development).
